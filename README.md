## 📌 Overview

The **AI Engineering Workspace** is a modern, AI-powered development environment built using **v0.app** and deployed via **Vercel**.  
This repository stays **continuously in sync** with your v0 deployments, enabling a smooth, production-ready workflow from ideation to live release.

Any changes made in **v0.app** are automatically committed to this repository and deployed—removing manual syncing, CI friction, and deployment inconsistencies.

---

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The application is live at:

🔗 **https://vercel.com/gupta-02s-projects/v0-ai-engineering-workspace**

> Hosted on Vercel’s global edge network for fast and reliable performance.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **v0.app** – AI-assisted UI & application generation  
- **Vercel** – Hosting & continuous deployment  
- **React / Next.js** – Modern frontend framework *(via v0)*  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling *(v0 default)*

## 🔁 How It Works

This project follows a fully automated, end-to-end workflow:

1. Build and iterate on the application using **v0.app**
2. Deploy directly from the v0 interface
3. v0 automatically syncs changes to this GitHub repository
4. Vercel instantly deploys the latest version from `main`

> No manual commits. No deployment scripts. No broken pipelines.
